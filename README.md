## Intro

 I have spent countless hours in the past looking online for stylish images from the 60's and 70's for wallpapers for my computers and other devices. I also love to watch movies with 60's and 70's clothing, architecture and lifestyle and my most frequent starting point to find those movies is internet images. I would like to make it easier for other people who love those images to find what they want.
